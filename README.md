# UFO
# Challenge
The purpose of this project is to use Javascript to display a dynamic table on a webpage. 

For this, we have a data file for UFO sightings and several associated characteristics. We built javascript code and HTML code to display this table and added some CSS sytlization. Futher, we have added the ability to dynamically filter the table by any combination of date, city, state, country or shape of UFO so that others may uniquely interact with the data. 

To use the website, load the HTML file which will by default show all data in the table. In the boxes on the left of the webpage, add any additional filters you may want and press filter table to update the table. You can add or remove certain filters and then simply press update filter again to update! Be sure that your entered text is an exact match for the filtered criteria.

Further improvement to this could be made by adding the ability to sort the data based on the headers. Additionally, we could add functionality to allow interpretation of entries in the search box that would result in the correct search. For example, if someone typed in "California" right now, it would return nothing. But we could build in functionality that recognizes that "California" should be interpretted as "ca" and return the correct results. Finally, we could add a drop down menu or selection boxes for our filter items. This would help users know all the available values from the table which would especially be helpful for things like "Shape" where it isn't intuitive what all the potential shapes of UFOs could be!
